    abstract="What makes people want to go on with the effort required from life? Every epistemology of behavior must sooner or later cope with this basic question. The question is not so mysterious for nonhuman organisms, which presumably have built-in genetic programs instructing them to live as long as their physical machinery is able to function. But our species has a choice: With the development of consciousness, we have the ability to second-guess and occasionally override the instructions coded in our chromosomes. This evolutionary development has added a great deal of flexibility to the human repertoire of behaviors. But the freedom gained has its downside---too many possibilities can have a paralyzing effect on action (Schwartz 2000). Among the options we are able to entertain is that of ending our lives; thus, as the existential philosophers remarked, the question of why one should not commit suicide is fundamental to the understanding of human life.",

    abstract = {Game flow represents a state where the player is neither frustrated nor bored. In turn-based battle video games it can be achieved by Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA), whose research has begun rising over the last decade. This paper introduces an idea for incorporating DDA through the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to agents of turn-based battle video games. We design and implement an RL agent that shows, in a simple environment, the idea of how a game could achieve balance through adequate choices in actions depending on the player's level of skill.For achieving this purpose, we incorporated the design and implementation of state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) algorithm to the agent of our implemented game. In addition, we added tracking of the on-going games and depending on the frequency of the player's repeated wins or losses, the rewards of the RL agent are modified. This modification of the rewards has an impact on the RL agent's actions, which involves an increase/decrease of the difficulty of the battle game. The evaluation performed shows that the idea of the paper is demonstrated, since players face personalized challenges that we believe are in range of game flow.},
