    abstract = {Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) has been extensively used to study thermal transport at various length scales in many materials. In this method, two local thermostats at different temperatures are used to generate a nonequilibrium steady state with a constant heat flux. Conventionally, the thermal conductivity of a finite system is calculated as the ratio between the heat flux and the temperature gradient extracted from the linear part of the temperature profile away from the local thermostats. Here, we show that, with a proper choice of the thermostat, the nonlinear part of the temperature profile should actually not be excluded in thermal transport calculations. We compare NEMD results against those from the atomistic Green’s function method in the ballistic regime and those from the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method in the ballistic-to-diffusive regime. These comparisons suggest that in all the transport regimes, one should directly calculate the thermal conductance from the temperature difference between the heat source and sink and, if needed, convert it into the thermal conductivity by multiplying it with the system length. Furthermore, we find that the Langevin thermostat outperforms the Nosé-Hoover (chain) thermostat in NEMD simulations because of its stochastic and local nature. We show that this is particularly important for studying asymmetric carbon-based nanostructures, for which the Nosé-Hoover thermostat can produce artifacts leading to unphysical thermal rectification.},

  journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
  abstract = {In the realm of materials science, the integration of machine learning techniques has ushered in a transformative era. This study delves into the innovative application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generating heat flux data, a pivotal step in predicting lattice thermal conductivity within metallic materials. Leveraging GANs, this research explores the generation of meaningful heat flux data, which has a high degree of similarity with that calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. This study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in understanding the complex physical meaning of data in materials science. By harnessing the power of such AI to generate data that is previously attainable only through experiments or simulations, new opportunities arise for exploring and predicting properties of materials.}

  abstract = { A general type of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is discussed to show that the physical quantities such as complex susceptibility of magnetic or electric polarization and complex conductivity for electric conduction are rigorously expressed in terms of time-fluctuation of dynamical variables associated with such irreversible processes. This is a generalization of statistical mechanics which affords exact formulation as the basis of calculation of such irreversible quantities from atomistic theory. The general formalism of this statistical-mechanical theory is examined in detail. The response, relaxation, and correlation functions are defined in quantummechanical way and their relations are investigated. The formalism is illustrated by simple examples of magnetic and conduction problems. Certain sum rules are discussed for these examples. Finally it is pointed out that this theory may be looked as a generalization of the Einstein relation. }

abstract = {Condensation and frost formation degrade the heat transfer performance of air-conditioners and refrigerators. Yet, the frost formation mechanism has not been fully understood. In the present study, we numerically investigate nanoscale H2O droplets during cooling and ice formation utilizing classical molecular dynamics simulations. The mW potential is employed for the H2O molecules. A nanoscale H2O droplet is placed on a flat solid wall consisting of Pt or Pb atoms. We examine where ice nucleation is formed and how the ice formation proceeds inside the droplet, and then evaluate the time change in instantaneous interfacial thermal resistance between the H2O molecules and the solid wall. In common with Pt and Pb surfaces, the time changes in the instantaneous interfacial thermal resistance and the density depletion length are qualitatively consistent in the present transient thermal energy transfer process together with the phase change. In addition, the relation of the time-averaged instantaneous interfacial thermal resistance and the density depletion length are qualitatively consistent with the relation of the solid-liquid interfacial thermal resistance in the steady-state.}

This paper considers the rapid sintering technology characteristics, the sintering processes of the same diameters and hybrid diameters nanosilver solder paste are simulated from the microscope perspective based on the molecular dynamics simulation theory. By tracing the atoms' trajectories on the surface of the nanosilver particles, the dominant sintering mechanism is obtained. Then, the thermal conductivity of the sintered silver nanoparticles is calculated by the equilibrium molecular dynamics method. The simulation results show that the densest sintered silver layer with the highest thermal conductivity is obtained when the diameter ratio of hybrid nanosilver balls is around 1:1.4, which provides a technical reference for the future proportioning of nanosilver solder paste.}
